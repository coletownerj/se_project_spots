# Project 3: Spots

This is the third project for the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. This webpage is meant to be a media sharing app in which you can view user's profiles. Using Figma as the designed brief, we used HTML and CSS to create a responsive webpage for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile screen sizes.

## Project Features

-Semantic HTML 5
-Flat BEM file structure
-CSS flexbox and grid
-Respnsive views for different screen widths

## Plans for improving the project

-Interactivity with text overflow (i.e. expanding the profile name, description, or card titles when focused)
-Expanding the profile avatar and cards when selected to get a larger view

### Deployment
